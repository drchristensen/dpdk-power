"""The Scapy traffic generator.

A traffic generator used for functional testing, implemented with
`the Scapy library <https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
The traffic generator uses an interactive shell to run Scapy on the remote TG node.

The traffic generator extends :class:`framework.remote_session.python_shell.PythonShell` to

    This class extends the base with remote execution of scapy functions. All methods for
    processing packets are implemented using an underlying
    :class:`framework.remote_session.python_shell.PythonShell` which imports the Scapy library. This
    class also extends :class:`.capturing_traffic_generator.CapturingTrafficGenerator` to expose
    methods that utilize said packet processing functionality to test suites.

    Because of the double inheritance, this class has both methods that wrap scapy commands
    sent into the shell (running on the TG node) and methods that run locally to fulfill
    traffic generation needs.
    To help make a clear distinction between the two, the names of the methods
    that wrap the logic of the underlying shell should be prepended with "shell".

    Note that the order of inheritance is important for this class. In order to instantiate this
    class, the abstract methods of :class:`~.capturing_traffic_generator.CapturingTrafficGenerator`
    must be implemented. Since some of these methods are implemented in the underlying interactive
    shell, according to Python's Method Resolution Order (MRO), the interactive shell must come
    first.
